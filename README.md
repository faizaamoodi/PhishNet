Still in testing, until Google approves, I need to add your gmail account to the test users 
before you are able to sign into it.
It is preferable to create a new gmail account with not as much 
messages on there, as the AI model hasn't been trained.
If you don't want to create an account, I have one already made
I can give you the credentials if you ask for it.


You will need to have LFS installed to be able to fully test on the cmd line
otherwise use server (which is still in the works)
